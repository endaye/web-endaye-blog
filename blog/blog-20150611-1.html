        This Is My First Blog
    </h3>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p>This is my first blog here. I wanna use this blog as my notebook. There are two main parts of it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diary</strong><br>This notebook keeps tracking of my life. Show something interesting, say something to who I care.</li>
        <li><strong>Code book</strong><br>As a programmer, to review what I learnt is very important. So, there'll be many snippets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's all. Just for myself. Enjoy!</p>
