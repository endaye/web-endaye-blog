        This Is My First Blog
    </h3>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p>This is my first blog here. I wanna use this blog as my notebook. There are two main parts of it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diary: this keeps tracking of my life. Show something interesting, say something to who I care.</li>
        <li>Code book: as a programmer, to review what I learnt is very important. So, there'll be many snippets.</li>
    </ul>
    That's all. Just for myself. Enjoy!
